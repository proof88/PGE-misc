0)
This is a multi-project solution.
All projects are in 1 solution: PGE.
The reason why the whole solution is called PGE is that the main project here is PGE and the other
projects are side projects needed to be created for PGE during development. They are different projects
so can be built separately but dependencies should be considered.
Example: if someone wants to build CConsole, it has to get or build PFL.lib prior to building CConsole.

Project dependency tree:
  - PFL (.lib)
    - CConsole (.lib)
      - PGE (.lib)
        - gfxcore2   (.dll) (notice multiple runnables explained later in 1))
        - GGame      (.exe) (not published on GitHub so it might be absent)
        - ELTE-FAIL  (.exe)
        - PRooFPS-dd (.exe)
        - UnitTests  (.exe)

Build order is from top left to bottom right.
So CConsole depends on PFL, PGE depends on CConsole and PFL, etc.
ELTE-FAIL, gfxcore2 and UnitTests can be built in parallel since they have the same dependencies.


We have the following repos:
- PFL
- Console
- PGE
- gfxcore2
- ELTE-FAIL
- PGE-misc (for solution and other textfiles like this txt)
- PR00FPS (legacy Delphi project from 2007, not part of the solution)
- PRooFPS-dd (new project being worked on in 2022)
- proof88.github.io - online form of documentation

So as seen above, almost every project has its own repository. Exception is the UnitTests project, it lies in the same repo as PGE.

DebugTest_PRooFPS-dd configuration is for running unit tests for PRooFPS-dd: it defines the TESTING macro used by PRooFPS-dd project to decide which
WinMain() to be used: either the one in PRooFPS-dd.cpp or the other in PRooFPS-dd-Tests.cpp.
Unit tests for PFL and PGE use the basic Debug or Release configuration shared with other projects.

1) Different Runnables

A project may have multiple configurations, that could mean not only Release and Debug outputs but also executing different runnables.
Currently the only project having multible runnables is gfxcore2:
 - configurations with name EV2008P03* will build gfxcore2.dll, copy it to EV2008P03 sample directory and run EV2008P03 sample;
   - both Debug and Release versions of this configuration will do these same actions, but obviously compiler and linker settings are different according to name;
 - configurations DebugPR00FPS and ReleasePR00FPS will build gfxcore2.dll, copy it to PR00FPS directory and run PR00FPS;
   - Debug and Release settings for compiler and linker obviously don't affect the existing legacy PR00FPS build since that is a Delphi project, we leave it untouched,
     so if you want Debug or Release build of the legacy PR00FPS, you need to solve that from Delphi.

Even though EV2008P03Debug, EV2008P03Release, DebugPR00FPS and ReleasePR00FPS are valid project configurations for other projects such as UnitTests, there they
act like the project's simple Debug or Release configuration: build&run the given project, not a sample runnable or PR00FPS.

2) Documentation

Documentation can be generated with Doxygen (https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html).
There are multiple project files that can be used with Doxygen in PGE\PGE\Docs\ directory:
 - PURE_Doxyfile_external - this is for PURE end-users who are interested in API usage only;
 - PURE_Doxyfile_internal - this is for PURE developers who are interested more in the engine and its internals.

Both use PGE_DoxyLayout.xml as layout file.

When using PURE_Doxyfile_external, during documentation build process doxygen will print a lot of warnings like:
 - no uniquely matching class member found for (...);
 - documented symbol (...) was not declared or defined.
These are expected warnings. The reason is that we also use the source cpp files for documentation since the detailed
description of member functions are there, but we dont include the internal header files and we also exclude some
symbols such as all Impl classes. This is not affecting the quality of the external documentation since we just try
to hide as much internal stuff as we can. These warnings are not present with the PURE_Doxyfile_internal since there
we don't want to hide any internal stuff.

As you can see, all stuff required to generate either internal or external documentation is in PGE directory.

However, there is a separate repo called proof88.github.io, which contains generated internal documentation.
The content is updated at every major PGE or PRRE version release and available online at: https://proof88.github.io/pure-doc/index.html .

3) PRREallHeaders.h and PGEallHeaders.h should be included in EVERY SINGLE PRRE header file

4) PRREallHeaders.h and PGEallHeaders.h MUSTN'T include anything

5) include/internal/PRREpragmas.h and PGEpragmas.h MUSTN'T be included in any header files.
   They should be included in cpp files only.

6) We have EXTERNAL and INTERNAL header files.
   EXTERNAL headers are public, meaning that they will be delivered
	to API-users as well, so they should contain as minimal info about internals as they can.
   INTERNAL headers are private headers, used for compiling the library, etc. They MUSTN'T be included in EXTERNAL headers.

7) PGEconsts.h and PRREconsts.h are INTERNAL headers thus MUSTN'T be included in EXTERNAL headers.

I) adding support for a new TC (texture compression) in PRRE
	1. - new enum(s) should be added to both TPRRE_TEX_COMPRESSION_MODE and TPRRE_TEX_FORMAT
	2. - texture format enum(s) should be handled in both PRRETexture::DescribeTexFormatAndSize() and PRRETexture::getTargetInternalFormat()
	3. - PRREhwVideoDiscoverOpenGL_1_3::DiscoverTextureCompressionAvailability() should be also updated with checking for the new TC
	4. - creating textures in unit tests with the new TC is not neccessarily needed but testGetInternalFormat() should handle them when PRRE_TC_AUTO is used:
		 tex128x128x24_cmpAUTO and tex128x128x32_cmpAUTO cases.
		 testGetUsedTextureMemory() should be also updated when the compression ratio is different than the already checked ratios (1:4, 1:8) for the cmpAUTO cases
		 mentioned above.
	5. - update relevant comments regarding to the TC. For example, if borders are supported by the TC or not: PRRETextureManager::setDefaultCompressionMode().
