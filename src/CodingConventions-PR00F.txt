1. Naming conventions
=====================

 A - local / non-const global / non-const member variables: Hungarian notation and lowerCamelCase, like:
     pPointer, nCount, sPlayerName, etc ...

 B - all function names including class member functions should use lowerCamelCase or UpperCamelCase, depending on the return value:
     - lowerCamelCase when the function has a return value
     - UpperCamelCase when the function doesn't return anything (void function)

 C - macro, struct, enum, enum constants and global / member const definitions: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES, like:
     MY_MACRO, MY_STRUCT, MY_ENUM, MY_CONST

 D - class names: UpperCamelCase, like:
     MyMathClass


2. Source formatting
====================

 A - opening comment: every file should contain an opening comment describing the content of the file and contact info, like:
     /*
        ###################################################################################
        MyFileXYZ.cpp
        This file is part of Project XY.
        TODO: External/Internal header.
        MyFileXYZ class.
        Made by PR00F88
        EMAIL : PR0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0oF88@gmail.com
        ###################################################################################
     */

 B - class definitions in header files:
     - member definition order (from left to right):
       - public, protected, private;
       - static, non-static;
       - const, non-const.

     - a comment line should divide member variables from member functions, and static members from non-statics:
       // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     - opening and closing braces always stand alone in their own lines

     - align member variable and function declarations to form columns: type, name, etc ... for example:
       int         nCount;
       std::string sName;
       bool        bInitialized; 
	      
     - when a ctor has an initializer list, the colon should be after the name of the ctor in the same line, and
       list elements should be under in separate lines, example:
       class ClassXY
       {
           int x, y;
       public:
           ClassXY() :
             x( 2 ),
             y( 5 )
           {}
       }

 C - class definitions in cpp files:
     - member definition order rule is same as in the header files;

     - opening and closing braces always stand alone in their own lines;

     - single comment lines should divide public, protected and private members, like:
       // ############################### PUBLIC ################################
       ...
       // ############################## PROTECTED ##############################
       ...
       // ############################### PRIVATE ###############################
       ...

     - if there are multiple classes in the same cpp file, they should be divided also by comments, like:
       /*
          MyClass1
          ###########################################################################
       */
         ...
       /*
          MyClass2
          ###########################################################################
       */

     - when a ctor has an initializer list, rule about colon and list elements are same as in the header file;

 D - a comment should be always placed after including a precompiled header, like:
     #include "MyHeader.h"  // PCH

 E - use 4 space characters instead of 1 tab character for indentations (this may not apply within comment blocks)

 F - opening and closing braces always stand alone in their own lines

 G - "else" statements also stand alone in their own lines, like:
     if ( ... )
     {
         ...
     }
     else
     {
         ...
     }

 H - pad parenthesed expressions with spaces, like
     if ( cond1 && cond2 ) ...

 I - local and global variables declared under each other should be aligned as mentioned at class definitions (2B)

 J - when declaring a pointer or reference, put the * or & char right after the typename it points or refers to, for example:
     
	 instead of these:
     i  - char *ptr;
     ii - char &ref;

     use these:
     i  - char* ptr;
     ii - char& ref;

 K - if there is not enough space within a line for a function prototype and wrapping should be applied, then wrap it right after
     the opening parentheses so the first argument goes into the next line. All lines after the first line should be indented.
     This rule applies to both declaring and defining a function. Example:

     void LongLongLongFunctionPrototypeExample(
        int arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4,
        bool arg5, void* arg6);

 I - a line shouldn't be longer than ~150 chars.


3. File handling
================

 A - put each class declaration into separate header files, use 1 file for multiple classes only when it makes sense to put them together into 1 file

 B - make separate .cpp file for each header file for class definitions. This is very important if we are making a library, to ensure everything will go into
     the generated static library, so no unresolved external symbol problem will happen when we try to use the library from some other program. See also 6A.

 C - file names should properly suggest their content. When containing a class, the file name should be the class name, for example:
     MyClass.h and MyClass.cpp contain the declaration and definition of MyClass.

 D - minimize including headers in header files when possible. Use the following techniques to minimize includes:
     - if a header is only included because a class name is used, then dont include the header, instead forward declare the named class;
       Then the header of the used class can be included in the cpp file later;
     - use minimized STL headers if applicable, like iosfwd instead of iostream, etc.
     - see CppHeaderFileGuidelines.pdf (David Kieras, EECS Dept., University of Michigan)

 E - MyClass.cpp should include MyClass.h first, then all the other needed headers (only exception is the precompiled header mentioned in next point);

 F - precompiled header files should be included only in .cpp files.
	 Precompiled headers must be the first included headers in .cpp files.
	 If precompiled header is at different level directory-wise, you have to make sure its location is also updated in cpp file properties:
     you can set the precompiled headers per each cpp file: right click on cpp > Properties > C/C++ > Precompiled Headers > Precompiled Header File should be relative path.

 G - after applying rules E and F, other headers include order should be the following:
     - standard C/CPP header files in alphabetical order,
     - other 3rd party header files,
     - then all other header files part of the project, try to include them in alphabetical order too.


4. Strict coding - General
==========================

 A - use precision specifier letters as much as you can in floating-point literals, like:
     
	 float f = 5.0f
     
	 instead of
     float f = 5.0 (defaults to double)

 B - use "const" everywhere as much as you can, for every member function, returned pointer/reference, local / global variables, etc.
     
	 For formal parameters, don't over-use const! The rule is to use it only if it's makes sense for the caller, for example:
     
	 use
       i   - void print(const char* text) {...};
       ii  - void f(const MyClass& text) {...};
       iii - void g(int num) {...};
     
	 instead of:
       i   - void print(const char* const text) {...};
       ii  - void f(MyClass& text) {...};
       iii - void g(const int num) {...};
     
	 when we don't want to change the given entity on the outside.

 C - use const references as read-only parameters only when the passed parameter will be used only to read from AND it's not a small, single type. Good examples:
     
	 void f(const BigClass& a);  // we just read 'a' and won't modify it, won't even copy it to modify locally
     void f(int a);       // intentionally not a const-reference because int is a single type, using reference here may reduce performance a bit!
     void f(BigClass a);  // do this when although you don't have to modify the object on the outside but need a local non-const copy of it, this could be faster
                             than manually copying it!

     See next point also for exception!

 D - const references as read-only parameters should also be used for small types when defining class ctors and operators.
     This is for achieving a consistent parametering rule.

 E - use references as parameters instead of pointers where you can, to avoid extra null-checking and for better readability;

 F - make functions inline ONLY WHEN the function is small AND doesn't call another function!

 K - never put "using namespace" statement into a header file!


5. Strict coding - Classes
==========================

 A - structs should be used as simple data containers without own functionality, so put only data members into them.
     Exception: simple ctors can be allowed just to initialize the members with PREDEFINED values (no dynamic memory allocation, etc...).

 B - don't forget to make private the copy ctor and assignment operators of classes which don't support copying / assigning yet.
     Ctor and dtor should be also private in case of singletons.
     
     private:
         ClassXYZ(const ClassXYZ&) {}; 
         ClassXYZ& operator=(const ClassXYZ&) { return *this; };
     
     Since C++11, these can be also deleted with " = delete".
     Since C++11, move ctor and move assignment operator can be also deleted if not needed.

 C - use the "explicit" keyword for 1-param non-copy ctors, for example:
     class XYZ
     {
         explicit XYZ(int count) { ... }
     }

     This way mistakes from implicit conversions can be avoided.

 D - always declare dtors virtual!

 E - dynamic_cast can be used to cast down in the class hierarchy but always think about if it can be avoided by re-thinking the polymorphism.

 F - friend classes: "The rule of thumb: If public is too weak and private is too strong, you need some form of selected access: either protected or
     friend (the package access specifier in Java serves the same kind of role)." "In general, you should strive for strong cohesion and weak coupling.
     This is why friend is so little used, it is recommended to reduce coupling between classes. However, there are situations where strong coupling
     gives better encapsulation. In those cases, you probably need a friend."
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6718209/when-should-you-use-friend-classes


6. In case of API development
=============================

 A - to ensure everything goes into the generated lib file, create cpp files for each header file (3B) and put all implementation into the cpp file.
     This applies also to empty methods, like an empty ctor, etc.

 B - you may declare and define the following class methods to avoid auto-generation by the compiler (C++98/03): 
     default ctor, copy ctor, dtor, copy assignment operator. This is to avoid unexpected hidden method generation by the compiler that may screw up
     the theoretical layout of your object.

 C - you don't know how a class coming from a public header and library really looks like - thus you can't make any assertions about how to correctly
     call its methods: you call a method which may end up in another method in practice.

 D - if a library we are using in external program changes, it's better to do a clean rebuild to avoid strange problems (~fragile binary interface problem).
     We dont have to do full rebuild if the Pimpl idiom (6F) is used.

 E - if we are creating a base class and some other class may be derived from our base class, the derived class may override some methods in the base class
     which can change the behavior of the base class itself - if the derived overrides a method that is actually used in the base class by some other method
     (~fragile base class problem). This can be avoided for published classes if the Pimpl idiom (6F) is used.

 F - the Pimpl idiom: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PimplIdiom .
     - change the class by putting all the private members into another class, this will be the implementation class defined in the cpp file hidden from outside world;
     - put the implementation class definition in the .cpp file;
     - put forward declaration of the impl class in the external header file (there will be 1 header file only which can be published with the static lib itself);
       note: forward declaration can go into the private part of the class right before the ptr mentioned next;
     - in the class definition, declare a (smart) pointer to the hidden class instance as the only private member variable (this private ptr will be seen though);
     - most public methods in the public class just simply call the methods of the impl class (this is a redirection actually);
     - some public method implementations may stay in the public class, especially when they call protected members;
     - all protected methods in the public class should stay there with the actual implementation so descendants can actually use them;
     - minimize protected members as possible - so hide the implementation details as possible;
     - public class is the friend of the implementation class;
     - ctors, copy ctors, assignment operators of the implementation should be private since no class will descend from these classes and we should stop
       everyone "accidentally" instantiating such classes from some nasty custom code;
     - the ctors of the public class need to create the hidden class instance;
     - the dtor of the public class needs to destroy the hidden class instance (possibly implicitly due to use of a smart pointer);
     - the assignment operator and copy ctor need to copy the implementation class instance appropriately or else be disabled.
     
	 Note: whenever a function in the public class is called, usually some function or data in the hidden half is needed to complete the request.
     That’s fine and reasonable. But as discussed already, sometimes a function in the Pimpl must call a nonprivate or virtual function in the visible class.
     In that case, it needs a pointer to the visible class. Recommended option: pass this as a parameter to the Pimpl functions (e.g., pimpl->func(this, params) ).
     http://herbsutter.com/gotw/_100/

     Since the public class in the header will be public for the user, comments for the public class should be left there.
     In the cpp file, duplicate comments should be avoided.
     In the cpp file, the implementation class definition shouldn't have the comments copied from the header.
     Also, the implementation of member functions of the implementation class shouldn't have comments if those functions are indirectly called from the public class.
     This means that in the cpp file, detailed comments of the methods of the public class should be placed at the implementation of the methods of the public class
     and not at the implementation of the methods of the implementation class.

 G - Interfaces instead of pimpls.
     You should think about how your public class will be used by users: in case it will be used by value, like it will be copied, passed to functions, etc., then
     that class should use the pimpl idiom (5F). However, if the class will be used as an entity, like a singleton, then that class should be an interface, a
     pure virtual class (or at least abstract if derived from some other class), with a static factory function, and the implementation should be put into the cpp file.
     The static factory should create and return a new instance of the implementation class derived from the public class.
     Default ctor, copy ctor, dtor, copy assignment operators may not be defined by the user for abstract classes since they can't be instantiated anyway.
     
     Since the interface will be public for the user, comments for the public class should be left there.
     In the cpp file, duplicate comments should be avoided.
     In the cpp file, the implementation class definition shouldn't have the comments copied from the header.
     Detailed member function comments should be placed right at their implementations.

 H - Singleton pimpl instead of interface.
     Sometimes you'd choose interface style for your class because it should be used as a singleton entity but on the other hand you'd like your class to be deriveable.
     In this case, simply use the pimpl idiom while the class remains as a singleton.


7. Exceptions
=============

 A - Exception transparency:
     "Note that the constructor re-throws a caught exception. The intent is to make vector transparent to exceptions so that the user can determine the exact cause of a problem.
     All standard-library containers have this property. Exception transparency is often the best policy for templates and other ‘‘thin’’ layers of software.
     This is in contrast to major parts of a system (‘‘modules’’) that generally need to take responsibility for all exceptions thrown. That is, the implementer of such a module
     must be able to list every exception that the module can throw. Achieving this may involve grouping exceptions, mapping exceptions from lower-level routines into the module’s
     own exceptions, or exception specification" (https://www.stroustrup.com/except.pdf).

 B - About exceptions in constructors:
     "when an exception is thrown from a constructor, sub-objects (such as bases) that have already been completely constructed will be properly destroyed" (https://www.stroustrup.com/except.pdf).
     
     "The two-phase construction approach leads to more complicated invariants and typically to less elegant, more error-prone, and harder-to-maintain code. Consequently, the
     language-supported ‘‘constructor approach’’ should be preferred to the ‘‘init()-function approach’’ whenever feasible. That is, resources should be acquired in constructors
     whenever delayed resource acquisition isn’t mandated by the inherent semantics of a class.
     Having a separate init() function is an opportunity to
      (1) forget to call init(),
      (2) call init() more than once,
      (3) forget to test on the success of init(),
      (4) forget that init() might throw an exception, and
      (5) use the object before calling init().
     Constructors and exceptions were introduced into C++ to prevent such problems." (https://www.stroustrup.com/except.pdf)

     "If a constructor throws an exception, the object’s destructor is not run. If your object has already done something that needs to be undone (...), this “stuff that needs to be undone”
     must be remembered by a data member inside the object." (https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/exceptions#selfcleaning-members)
     For example, if constructor already allocated some memory on the heap, then an exception happens, the constructor is responsible for freeing that allocated memory up, and the best way
     to do that if a smart pointer or something similar was used, so that no explicit deallocation in the catch block is needed for that since the smart pointer's destructor will be called
     automatically anyway during the stack unwinding process.

     "To handle exceptions arising in from the initialization list C++ provides function try block."
     "Since there is no way to know how farther in the initialization list the exception occurred, any member or base class sub-objets created so far are destroyed before entering inside
     the handler. Moreover, the non-static members or base class can’t be accessed, thus you can’t attempt any sort of recovery. This is the intentional behavior."
     (https://medium.com/cpp-station/exception-handling-in-constructors-26bf4c811b46)

     Based on all above info, I will mark my constructors instantiating their internal impl parts explicitly as noexcept(false), to make sure whoever wants to use these classes is aware
     of that fact that try-catch should be used when using these classes. This approach is independent of the fact whether I catch the exception of creating impl object in the constructor
     or not, since even if I'm catching the exception I will re-throw it for sure!

     Functions that definitely do not throw any kind of exceptions, should be marked with noexcept(true), API doc should mention their nothrow guarantee.
     Functions not marked with noexcept specifier might throw, their documentation should state their exception-safety guarantee: basic or strong, as explained later.

 C - About exceptions in destructors: do not throw exceptions in destructors, except if you catch them WITHIN the destructor. Don't allow exceptions to escape from destructors or
     memory-deallocation functions.
     One major reason for this is that if an exception occurs anywhere and stack unwinding (i.e. destroying local objects before exiting the scope) is happening right
     before entering the exception handling catch block, an object destructor throwing an exception can lead to a state where an exception is raised even before properly handling
     the previous exception, and also resources might had been leaked since the stack unwinding process was not properly finished. Even a throwing destructor can lead to
     partially destructed objects since in case of inheritance, where the order of destructor calls is from most derived class towards the base class, any exception thrown during these calls
     will leave the object partially destroyed.
     
     "C++ specifications state that you should never throw an exception before any existing exception has been handled. This means that the stack unwinding process should never throw an exception"
     (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2331316/what-is-stack-unwinding).
     
     "A delete expression can throw, if the destructor itself throws, or a destructor of a sub object. But you should avoid throwing in a destructor."
     (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35571298/in-what-context-does-the-delete-operator-throw-an-error)

 D - Exception safety:
     "An operation on an object is said to be exception safe if that operation leaves the object in a valid state when the operation is terminated by throwing an exception."
     Clearly an exception thrown by the constructor means that object is not constructed, therefore we don't talk about exception safety in case of constructors.
     
     "C++ standard library provides a set of exception-safety guarantees that share the burden of producing correct programs between implementers of the standard library and users of the standard library:
     ‘‘Basic guarantee for all operations:’’ The basic invariants of the standard library are maintained, and no resources, such as memory, are leaked.
     ‘‘Strong guarantee for key operations:’’ In addition to providing the basic guarantee, either the operation succeeds, or has no effects. This guarantee is provided for key library operations, such as
                                              push_back(), single-element insert() on a list , and uninitialized_copy().
     ‘‘Nothrow guarantee for some operations:’’ In addition to providing the basic guarantee, some operations are guaranteed not to throw an exception. This guarantee is provided for a few simple operations,
                                                such as swap() and pop_back()." (https://www.stroustrup.com/except.pdf)

     The last guarantee is the strongest.
     A class "preventing itself from being partially constructed or partially destroyed" is also a must-have to say the class is exception-safe.
     (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/errors-and-exception-handling-modern-cpp?view=msvc-160)

 E - exceptions vs assertions:
     "Use assert statements to test for conditions during development that should never be true if all your code is correct. There's no point in handling such an error by using an exception, because
     the error indicates that something in the code has to be fixed. It doesn't represent a condition that the program has to recover from at run time. (...)
     Use exceptions to check error conditions that might occur at run time even if your code is correct, for example, "file not found" or "out of memory."
     Exceptions can handle these conditions, even if the recovery just outputs a message to a log and ends the program." (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/errors-and-exception-handling-modern-cpp?view=msvc-160)

 F - Misc:
     "Throw exceptions by value, catch them by reference. Don’t catch what you can't handle." (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/errors-and-exception-handling-modern-cpp?view=msvc-160)


8. Threads, thread-safety
=========================

 A - Variables accessed from different threads concurrently can lead to undefined behavior.
   Due to possible compiler optimization, CPU out-of-order execution, or caching, the behavior of the program might be different than expected.
   Example: thread A executed by 1 CPU core changes such variable, but thread B executed by another CPU core will never see the change because it has its
   cached version of that variable (even thread A might just update the variable in cache, not even in operational memory, or even if it updates in operational memory,
   thread B might just don't update its cache from the operational memory).
   Solution:
   Cpp11 has atomic variables which get rid of this problem by using memory fences/barriers.
   The effect is similar to using mutex to protect such variables.
   And lastly: using "volatile" keyword is simple not enough.
